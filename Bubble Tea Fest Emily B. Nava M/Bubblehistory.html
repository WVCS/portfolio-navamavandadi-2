      All about us <br> 
     <pr> HOW WE CREATED BUBBLE TEA FEST  <br> 
       We have hosted this event every summer since 2019. We came up with this idea in spring of 2019 because we both love boba. We came up with this event last year and aired the event in summer and it was a big hit. Nava M. and Emily B. both love boba and that was the idea of this event. We invite all the most famous and best boba (personally tasted). </pr> 
       <br> <pr> BOBA NAMES <br> Originally, Boba drinks were called tapioca milk tea (or tapioca tea latte) or pearl milk tea. When it was introduced in Hong Kong, the locals called it Boba instead of Pearl because of its shape. Boba literally means "Big Pearls".
</pr> <br> 
       <pr> HISTORY <br> 
        Boba culture started in the late '80s, most likely in Taipei (though other cities in Taiwan often claim ownership). Milk tea was already well-known in Taiwan, as tea drinking was a robust practice in East Asia. At the time, both shaved ice and tapioca balls were common desserts. During one hot summer a savvy food stall owner thought to combine three popular elements into one beverageâ€”tapioca balls on the bottom, followed by a layer of shaved ice, and milk tea to fill out the rest of the drink. </pr>
