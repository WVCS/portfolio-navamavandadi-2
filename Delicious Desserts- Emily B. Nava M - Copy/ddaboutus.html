       <h1> About Us </h1><pre>
       To find the perfect recipe, you first need the perfect ingredients. 
       And that's what our founders Nava Mavandadi and Emily Butman were for each other. 
       
 In 2020, they joined forces in Web Design, or better yet kitchens, to make desserts for their friends and family. 
       The cakes, milkshakes, brownies and others they made were delicious, unlike anything anyone had tasted. 
       As a result, their friends and family asked them to entertain more and more.

They quickly realized this side project of theirs could be something more. 
There was a gap in the world for delicious cakes, readily available, that didn't compromise on their ingredients.
Real eggs, butter and cream cheese, 
and freshly whipped cream topped with fresh fruit; nothing was too good to achieve perfection.

Flash forward and the Delicious Desserts brand has grown nationwide. 
Built on Nava and Emily's vision, each bakery still has the warmth and nostalgia of its home-kitchen roots, 
but we also take a modern approach for the world today.
So whether you're enjoying a coconut milk boba drink or our red velvet cookie dough brownies, 
topped with fresh strawberries, one thing is certain â€“ perfection is all we offer.
