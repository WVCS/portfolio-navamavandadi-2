    <p>  Where it all began <br> 
    The Mava's is a basement grown band, that produces indie rock music. The two twin sisters were always passionate about music every since they were little, but had staryed away from it once they entered high school. Now that they have extra time on their hands due to quarantine, they have decided to rekindle the passion they had for music.  </div>
